        description: "Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought about a significant change in the field of artificial intelligence, where they have transitioned in scope from being specialized research tools to common resources that drive the next generation of software. With increasing model parameters and training data, LLMs demonstrate new abilities in reasoning, code generation, and solving complex problems that were once considered unattainable. However, scaling these models effectively for long-context applications uniquely poses a challenge. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of the self-attention mechanism, which has quadratic time complexity. This quadratic bottleneck hinders applications for long documents, high-resolution images, and large codebases, among others. However, what is interesting to observe is that effectively only a few parameters are used in token computation, and most calculations are sparse. Hence, sparsity emerges as an effective solution to this problem. Rather than relying on the entire attention matrix, one can utilize an approximate or sparse version of attention to achieve almost the same results much faster. The backbone of this approach is the idea that tokens do not require the entire context; they only need local context, and thus, most of the computation carried out is wasteful. In this blog, we analyze the types of attention patterns that emerge and how to use them to our advantage for faster and efficient LLMs.",

Sampler quality can be evaluated in a data-free manner, using only the model and the target potential, or in a data-driven manner, with additional data about the target distribution such as known modes, summary statistics, and reference MCMC samples. While data-driven eval is valuable, data-free eval has compelling conceptual advantages, raising the question of how well data-free eval could work. Here, we prove an impossibility trilemma for data-free sampler evaluation; we can only have two among i) mode-covering metric, ii) stable with finite variance, iii) universal ranking (dominance transitivity guarantee / model score does not depend on other models). This note surveys underexplored design space of data-free sampler eval metrics, and asks the community which eval properties we are willing to sacrifice in the face of the impossibility of satisfying all of them.",

We take a deeper look into the mechanics and interface of the NLE and show that much of the complexity of NetHack is inaccessible due to constraints on the observation and action spaces.

        description: "Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts. While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies show they often rely on shallow heuristics such as copying or majority voting, rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with reasoning pipeline that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception- and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0 and 2.5. We conduct controlled studies varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, indicating that current VLMs fail to effectively utilize demonstration-level information and thus do not inherit the strong few-shot abilities of large language models (LLMs). We further conduct a mechanistic analysis showing that VLMs exhibit weak prefix matching and lack induction-head-like behavior, which potentially explains the failure of MM-ICL.",

This article systematically organizes the diffusion model from a fresh Langevin perspective, aiming to present diffusion models in a simpler, clearer, and more intuitive way while addressing the following questions 1. How does the reverse process invert the forward process to generate data from pure noise? 2. How can ODE-based and SDE-based diffusion models be unified under a single framework? 3. Why are diffusion models theoretically superior to ordinary VAEs? 4. Why is Flow Matching not fundamentally simpler, but equivalent to Denoising and Score Matching from first principles? We demonstrate that the diffusion model offers clear and straightforward answers to these questions, providing pedagogical value for both learners and experienced researchers seeking deeper intuition.",

        description: "Motivated by the increasing deployment of LLMs for safety-critical applications, we provide an accessible introduction to a practical suite of interpretability tools useful for understanding LLMs’ behavior during safety-critical decisions. Previous discussions of interpretability are often heavily focused on these methods&#39; technical aspects, rather than giving practical guidance for their immediate use; here, we provide practitioners with an overview of a range of methods for understanding LLM behavior. For each method covered, we highlight what it can and cannot tell us, and how this can help inform deployment decisions.",

This design allows for continuous adaptation without fine-tuning and enables a seamless transition from rigid hierarchical structures to decentralized networks, providing a reference architecture for the robust and scalable construction of MAS.",

        description: "Autoregressive (AR) models are central to modern generative AI systems, yet their need for an ordered sequence of tokens clashes with modalities that lack an obvious ordering, such as images, graphs, and point clouds. Despite this mismatch, AR models are widely applied beyond language owing to their scalability and controllability. In this post, we articulate exactly what the problem is, and how it can be solved. In short, there are two broad classes of techniques for applying AR models to non-sequential data: selecting a generation order given some fixed tokenization scheme, and redesigning the tokenization itself to simplify next-token prediction. Yet these methods face tradeoffs, particularly between compression (how many bits are used to represent the input) and autoregressive &amp;quot;modelability&amp;quot; (how easy it is to model each next-token conditional distribution in the chosen order). We predict that as data-hungry AI pipelines require new data modalities to train integrated, multi-modal models, these considerations will only grow more crucial. By drawing these connections, we aim to motivate future work on tokenizations tailored to the needs of autoregressive models for arbitrary datatypes.",
