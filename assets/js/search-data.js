        description: "Diffusion models have transformed generative modeling, powering breakthroughs like Stable Diffusion in images and Sora in video. Yet despite their success, diffusion models share a key limitation - spectral bias; they learn broad, low-frequency structure well but struggle to recover fine, high-frequency details. This happens because the standard uniform noise schedule adds the same Gaussian noise to every frequency band, even though real datasets have very different frequency characteristics. When high-frequency components are overwhelmed with noise early in the forward process, the model learns to regenerate them last, and often poorly leading to the blurred textures and softened edges we observe in many diffusion outputs. Frequency-Adaptive Noise Shaping (FANS) offers a potential way to address this limitation. Instead of treating all frequencies equally, FANS dynamically reshapes the noise distribution based on the true frequency importance of the dataset. This simple yet principled modification plugs directly into existing DDPM architectures and improves denoising where it matters most. Across synthetic datasets (with controlled spectral properties) and real-world benchmarks—including CIFAR-10, CelebA, Texture, and MultimodalUniverse—FANS consistently outperforms vanilla DDPMs, with sharper high-frequency details, lower FID, higher PSNR on reconstruction tasks, and marked gains on texture-rich domains (e.g., up to significant relative improvements in perceptual sharpness and detail fidelity). And crucially, it achieves these benefits without sacrificing performance on standard natural-image datasets.",

We start by explaining technical implementations of such conversions and their strengths. We then perform evaluation on long context understanding benchmarks that are more challenging than those used in prior works, with the objective to better analyze how these methods work or fail.

Through thought experiments and concrete probes, the post shows how representational limits, identifiability barriers, and optimization constraints create predictable blind spots in model behavior. Understanding this shadow is essential for building safer systems, designing better benchmarks, and avoiding misplaced confidence in model outputs.

While effective in narrow benchmarks, this paradigm faces fundamental limitations for developing general-purpose robots that operate in complex, dynamic environments.

However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fostering a synthesis of these paradigms through a fundamental architectural shift: the move from Dense Monoliths to Modular, Routed Systems. This shift is fractal. At the Macro level, LLMs function as central planners, using symbolic protocols to orchestrate external tools and specialized neural agents. Simultaneously, at the Micro level, the models themselves are evolving into sparse, modular structures (such as Mixture-of-Experts) governed by internal routing mechanisms. In this post, we explore this transition toward Symbolic Routing. We discuss how this paradigm enables us to build societies of neural agents, discover latent modularity within dense networks, thus enabling composable, verifiable, interpretable and continually learnable AI system. And we also discuss how to leverage these structures to synthesize training data and formally verify AI reasoning.",

With increasing model parameters and training data, LLMs demonstrate new abilities in reasoning, code generation, and solving complex problems that were once considered unattainable. However, scaling these models effectively for long-context applications uniquely poses a challenge. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of the self-attention mechanism, which has quadratic time complexity. This quadratic bottleneck hinders applications for long documents, high-resolution images, and large codebases, among others. However, what is interesting to observe is that effectively only a few parameters are used in token computation, and most calculations are sparse. Hence, sparsity emerges as an effective solution to this problem. Rather than relying on the entire attention matrix, one can utilize an approximate or sparse version of attention to achieve almost the same results much faster. The backbone of this approach is the idea that tokens do not require the entire context; they only need local context, and thus, most of the computation carried out is wasteful. In this blog, we analyze the types of attention patterns that emerge and how to use them to our advantage for faster and efficient LLMs.",

We prove this gap is architectural, not fundamental. Online RLVR can be reformulated exactly as offline supervised fine-tuning with importance-weighted samples. We introduce Decoupled Generation &amp; Optimization (DGO), a two-phase paradigm that separates generation from optimization, reducing peak memory by ~18-31% and training time by ~75-85% while enabling multi-epoch training. Our framework unifies existing offline methods, exposes systematic theory-practice mismatches, and establishes DGO as the first method where theoretical optimal weights align perfectly with implementation.

While data-driven eval is valuable, data-free eval has compelling conceptual advantages, raising the question of how well data-free eval could work. Here, we prove an impossibility trilemma for data-free sampler evaluation; we can only have two among i) mode-covering metric, ii) stable with finite variance, iii) universal ranking (dominance transitivity guarantee / model score does not depend on other models).

While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies show they often rely on shallow heuristics such as copying or majority voting, rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with reasoning pipeline that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception- and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0 and 2.5. We conduct controlled studies varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, indicating that current VLMs fail to effectively utilize demonstration-level information and thus do not inherit the strong few-shot abilities of large language models (LLMs). We further conduct a mechanistic analysis showing that VLMs exhibit weak prefix matching and lack induction-head-like behavior, which potentially explains the failure of MM-ICL.",

How can ODE-based and SDE-based diffusion models be unified under a single framework? 2. Why are diffusion models theoretically superior to ordinary VAEs? 3. Why is flow matching not fundamentally simpler than denoising or score matching, but equivalent under maximum-likelihood?

We examine how local edits differ from global ones, why forgetting resembles suppression rather than deletion, and how repeated modifications can change a model’s identity. By framing model editing as a philosophical and structural question rather than a purely technical procedure, this piece highlights the need to evaluate edits not only for local correctness but also for their impact on coherence, ontology, and long-term behavior.",

This post explores these questions, arguing that language technologies are not just tools that support scientific work (like literature search agents, writing tools, or coding assistants), but that by treating language as a window into the human mind, NLP and LLMs can actively help researchers uncover mechanisms of human behavior, cognition, and brain function.",

We propose in-context neurofeedback, a method that uses multi-turn conversation to control internal representations while satisfying the privileged access requirement, and we provide a methodological framework for future investigations into machine metacognition.",

These methods typically assume that simulators faithfully represent the true data-generating process, an assumption that is often violated in practice. Resulting discrepancies can make observed data effectively out-of-distribution relative to the simulations, leading to biased posterior distributions and misleading uncertainty quantification. This post reviews recent work on model misspecification in neural SBI, covering formal definitions, methods for detection and mitigation, and their underlying assumptions.

We first summarize and taxonomize these diverse conflicts. Then, we model the LLM&#39;s preferences to make different choices as a priority graph, where instructions and values are nodes, and the edges represent context-specific priorities determined by the model&#39;s output distribution. This graph reveals that a unified stable LLM alignment is very challenging, because the graph is not static in different contexts. Besides, it also reveals a potential vulnerability: priority hacking, where adversaries can craft deceptive contexts to manipulate the graph and bypass safety alignments. To counter this, we propose a runtime verification mechanism, enabling LLMs to query external sources to ground their context and resist manipulation. While this approach enhances robustness, we also acknowledge that many ethical and value dilemmas are philosophically irreducible, posing an open challenge for the future of AI alignment.",

        description: "Park et al., 2025 find that when large language models process random walks on a graph in-context, the geometry of their token representations comes to mirror the graph&#39;s connectivity structure. This suggests a two-step mechanism: the model first reshapes its representations to reflect the graph structure, then operates over them to predict valid next steps. We offer a simpler mechanistic explanation. The in-context graph tracing task can be solved by induction circuits, which implement a simple rule: if token B followed token A earlier in the sequence, predict B the next time A appears. Since consecutive tokens in a random walk are always graph neighbors, this rule naturally produces valid steps. Ablating the attention heads that comprise induction circuits substantially degrades task performance, compared to ablating random heads. As for the geometric structure of representations, we propose that induction circuits can account for this too: their previous-token heads mix each token&#39;s representation with that of its predecessor, always a graph neighbor in a random walk. We show that a single round of such &#39;neighbor mixing&#39; applied to random embeddings is sufficient to recreate the graph-like PCA structure. These results suggest that the observed representation geometry is a byproduct of how the model solves the task, not the means by which it does so.",

We introduce Chunked TabPFN, an exact tiling strategy that removes these implementation bottlenecks without retraining or approximation, extending TabPFN to 100K+ rows on a single GPU. On the long-context slice of TabArena, we find that — contrary to earlier reports — TabPFN&#39;s performance continues to improve with larger contexts, suggesting that the prior bottleneck was implementation-level memory, not model-level capacity.",

        description: "For most of the history of information retrieval (IR), search results were designed for human consumers who could scan, filter, and discard irrelevant information on their own. This shaped retrieval systems to optimize for finding and ranking more relevant documents, but not keeping results clean and minimal, as the human was the final filter. However, LLMs have changed that by lacking this filtering ability. To address this, we introduce Bits-over-Random (BoR), a chance-corrected measure of retrieval selectivity that reveals when high success rates mask random-level performance.",

        description: "Autoregressive (AR) models are central to modern generative AI systems, yet their need for an ordered sequence of tokens clashes with modalities that lack an obvious ordering, such as images, graphs, and point clouds. Despite this mismatch, AR models are widely applied beyond language owing to their scalability and controllability. In this post, we articulate exactly what the problem is, and how it can be solved. In short, there are two broad classes of techniques for applying AR models to non-sequential data: selecting a generation order given some fixed tokenization scheme, and redesigning the tokenization itself to simplify next-token prediction. Yet these methods face tradeoffs, particularly between compression (how many bits are used to represent the input) and autoregressive &amp;quot;modelability&amp;quot; (how easy it is to model each next-token conditional distribution in the chosen order). We predict that as data-hungry AI pipelines require new data modalities to train integrated, multi-modal models, these considerations will only grow more crucial. By drawing these connections, we aim to motivate future work on tokenizations tailored to the needs of autoregressive models for arbitrary datatypes.",
