Most explanations of these processes fall into three main frameworks: the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) perspective, the score-based perspective, and the flow-based perspective.</p> <p>The VAE perspective interprets the forward and backward diffusion processes as an encoder and decoder, respectively, applying Markov chain modeling, Bayes’ theorem, and using the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) as the training objective. While this approach is intuitive for much of the machine learning community, it involves lengthy mathematical derivations and often blurs a crucial distinction: in VAEs, both the prior and posterior are approximations, whereas in diffusion models, the prior and posterior are duals—they are exact in theory.</p> <p>The score-based perspective emphasizes the mathematical duality between the forward and backward processes. It usually introduces the forward process first and treats the backward process as an oracle, often citing Anderson (1982). However, grasping the full SDE or ODE formulation of the backward process requires familiarity with advanced concepts like the Kolmogorov equations and the continuity equation, making this approach less accessible. The strong focus on denoising score matching can also obscure its connection to maximum likelihood, further limiting its intuitive appeal.</p> <p>A third valuable perspective is the flow-based viewpoint, which has become increasingly popular in modern diffusion models. This approach is theoretically equivalent to both the VAE and score-based frameworks, but it distinguishes itself by emphasizing an intuitive and visually accessible straight-line interpolation between data and noise. While this simplicity makes the flow-based perspective appealing and approachable, it also carries the risk of oversimplification. Interpreting the forward and backward diffusion paths as mere straight-line interpolations may overlook the intricately paired relationship required for these processes to form an exact dual pair—an essential aspect underpinning the theoretical foundation of diffusion models.</p> <p>In this article, we offer a perspective that is both accessible and nuanced: the Langevin viewpoint. This approach maintains a focus on the dual nature of the forward and backward processes, while relying only on fundamental techinques of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The central insight is encapsulated in the following triangle relationship:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward-backward-langevin-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward-backward-langevin-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward-backward-langevin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward-backward-langevin.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>which illustrates the connection among the forward, backward diffusion process and the Langevin dynamics.</p> <h1 id="langevin-dynamics">Langevin Dynamics</h1> <p><strong>Langevin Dynamics</strong> is a special diffusion process that aims to generate samples from a probability distribution \(p(\mathbf{x})\). It is defined as:</p> \[d\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{s}(\mathbf{x}_t) dt + \sqrt{2} d\mathbf{W}_t, \label{langevin dynamics}\] <p>where \(\mathbf{s}(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})\) is the score function of \(p(\mathbf{x})\). This dynamics is often used as a Monte Carlo sampler to draw samples from \(p(\mathbf{x})\), since \(p(\mathbf{x})\) is its stationary distribution—the distribution that \(\mathbf{x}_t\) converges to and and remains at as \(t \to \infty\), regardless of the initial distribution of \(\mathbf{x}_0\).</p> <details> <summary><em>If you're comfortable simply assuming that $p(\mathbf{x})$ is the stationary distribution of the Langevin dynamics, you can skip this section. Otherwise, here is a short argument:</em> (click to expand)</summary> <ol> <li> <p>Write the dynamics in “energy” form as \(d\mathbf{x}_t = -\nabla E(\mathbf{x})\,dt + \sqrt{2}\,d\mathbf{W}_t\). The randomness $d\mathbf{W}_t$ perturbs the system to equilibrium, where states with the same energy $E(\mathbf{x})$ have equal probability. Thus, the stationary distribution is $p(\mathbf{x}) = f(E(\mathbf{x}))$ for some function $f$.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider $N$ independent copies $\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_N$. Their joint density is the product $p(\mathbf{x}_1) \cdots p(\mathbf{x}_N)$. Treating them as a single system, the total energy is additive: $E(\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_N) = \sum E(\mathbf{x}_i)$. So the joint stationary density must also be $g(\sum E(\mathbf{x}_i))$ for some function $g$. The only function satisfying both the product (independence) and sum (additivity) forms for all $N$ is the exponential: $f(E) = e^{-\beta E}$, yielding $p(\mathbf{x}) \propto e^{-\beta E(\mathbf{x})}$.</p> </li> <li> <p>To find $\beta$, take $E(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{x}|^2$, giving the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process $d\mathbf{x}_t = -\mathbf{x}\,dt + \sqrt{2}\,d\mathbf{W}_t$ with known stationary $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$, density $\propto e^{-\frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{x}|^2}$. Matching forms gives $\beta = 1$.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Thus, the dynamics \(d\mathbf{x}_t = -\nabla E(\mathbf{x})\,dt + \sqrt{2}\,d\mathbf{W}_t\) has stationary distribution \(\propto e^{-E(\mathbf{x})}\), and \(d\mathbf{x}_t = \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x}) \, dt + \sqrt{2} \, d\mathbf{W}_t\) has stationary distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$.</p> </details> <h3 id="langevin-dynamics-as-identity">Langevin Dynamics as ‘Identity’</h3> <p>The stationary of \(p(\mathbf{x})\) is very important: The Langevin dynamics for \(p(\mathbf{x})\) acts as an “identity” operation on this distribution, transforming samples from \(p(\mathbf{x})\) into new samples from the same distribution.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/langevin_id-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/langevin_id-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/langevin_id-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/langevin_id.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Langevin dynamics, while widely used for sampling from complex distributions, becomes inefficient in high-dimensional or multi-modal settings due to slow mixing and sensitivity to hyperparameters such as step size and noise scale; this inefficiency highlights the need for more structured sampling approaches that can better explore complicated data landscapes.</p> <h1 id="spliting-the-identity-forward-and-backward-processes-in-ddpm">Spliting the Identity: Forward and Backward Processes in DDPM</h1> <p>The Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) [^Ho2020DenoisingDP] are models that generate high-quality images from noise via a sequence of denoising steps. Denoting images as random variable \(\mathbf{x}\) of the probabilistic density distribution \(p(\mathbf{x})\), the DDPM aims to learn a model distribution that mimics the image distribution \(p(\mathbf{x})\) and draw samples from it. The training and sampling of the DDPM utilize two diffusion process: the forward and the backward diffusion process.</p> <h2 id="the-forward-diffusion-process">The Forward Diffusion Process</h2> <p>The forward diffusion process in DDPM generates the necessary training data: clean images and their progressively noised counterparts. It gradually adds noise to existing images \(\mathbf{x}_0 \sim p(x)\) using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion process (OU process) [^Uhlenbeck1930OnTT] within a finite time interval \(t\in [0,T]\). The OU process is defined by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):</p> \[d \mathbf{x}_t = - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}_t dt + d\mathbf{W}_t, \label{Forward Process}\] <p>in which \(t\) is the forward time of the diffusion process, \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is the noise contaminated image at time \(t\), and \(\mathbf{W}_t\) is a Brownian noise.</p> <p>Note that \(-\mathbf{x}\) is just the score function of the standard Gaussian distribution \(\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},I)\). Thus, the forward diffusion process corresponds to the Langevin dynamics of the standard Gaussian \(\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},I)\).</p> <p>The forward diffusion process has \(\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},I)\) as its stationary distribution. This means, for any initial distribution \(p_0(\mathbf{x})\) of positions \(\{\mathbf{x}_0^{(1)},...,\mathbf{x}_0^{(N)}\}\), their density \(p_t(\mathbf{x})\) converges to \(\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},I)\) as \(t\to\infty\). When these positions represent vectors of clean images, the process describes a gradual noising operation that transforms clean images into Gaussian noise.</p> <p>One forward diffusion step with a step size of \(\Delta t\) is displayed in the following picture.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward-480.webp 480w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward-800.webp 800w,/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/2026/assets/img/2026-04-27-rethinking-diffusion-Langevin/forward.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="the-backward-diffusion-process">The Backward Diffusion Process</h2> <p>The backward diffusion process is the conjugate of the forward process.

In practice, we approximate this function using a neural network. In the next section, we will explain how to train such score networks.</p> <h2 id="training-the-diffusion-model">Training the Diffusion Model</h2> <p>Previous section introduced <strong>Forward Process</strong> and <strong>Backward Process</strong> of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM).</p> <p><strong>Forward Process</strong></p> \[d \mathbf{x}_t = - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}_t dt + d\mathbf{W}_t,\] <p>where $t \in [0,T]$ is the forward diffusion time.

It is clear that the central object to model is the <strong>score function</strong>, which we typically represent with a neural network since it is unknown and generally intractable. In practice, there are several parameterizations of the score function—such as $x_0$ prediction, $\epsilon$ prediction, or velocity prediction from a flow-matching perspective—but all these variants are simply rescaled forms of the same underlying score function. However, it is less obvious how the score function should enter the training objective.</p> <p>The variational autoencoder (VAE) perspective addresses the training objective by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), a principled but approximate surrogate for maximum likelihood. While ELBO provides a systematic way to derive training objectives, this perspective can obscure the fact that diffusion models inherently perform true maximum likelihood estimation, distinguishing them from conventional VAEs and contributing to their empirical success.</p> <p>Alternatively, the score matching perspective motivates the use of <strong>denoised score matching</strong>, a method closely connected to maximum likelihood (see Lyu, S. (2009), <em>Interpretation and generalization of score matching</em>). However, employing the score function as a prior assumption—rather than deriving its necessity from first principles—limits the generality of this approach. Specifically, it becomes difficult to extend score matching to more general or discrete diffusion systems, where the notion of a continuous score function becomes less transparent.</p> <p>The flow matching perspective recasts score matching as “velocity learning” along straight lines, which simplifies the formalism. However, while this approach is easier to understand from first glance, it does not clarify the connection to maximum likelihood.</p> <p>To address these shortcomings, our goal is to derive the training objective directly from first principles, beginning with the maximum likelihood framework itself. By doing so, we reveal the fundamental connection between diffusion model loss and exact maximum likelihood, without presupposing the existence or explicit usage of the score function.</p> <h3 id="from-maximal-likelihood-to-denoising-objective">From Maximal likelihood to Denoising objective</h3> <p>We now look at maximum likelihood training of a diffusion model. Suppose we have two distributions $p(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and $q(\mathbf{x}, t)$ that both evolve under the same forward diffusion process. Think of $p$ as the <strong>true data distribution</strong> pushed forward by the diffusion dynamics, and $q$ as the <strong>model distribution</strong>. At any fixed time $t$, their Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is</p> \[\mathrm{KL}\big(p_t \Vert q_t\big) = \int p(\mathbf{x}, t)\,\log \frac{p(\mathbf{x}, t)}{q(\mathbf{x}, t)}\,d\mathbf{x}.\] <p>Maximum likelihood training of $p$ corresponds to minimizing this KL divergence at the data time $t=0$. In a diffusion model, however, we introduce an explicit <strong>forward diffusion time</strong> $t$ and then learn a <strong>backward (reverse-time) process</strong> that maps from noisy states back to data. Intuitively, this suggests that we should “distribute” the KL objective over diffusion time: instead of treating the KL only at $t=0$, we examine how it evolves along the forward process.</p> <p>The way to “distribute” the KL is consdering the <strong>time derivative</strong> of the KL divergence along the forward dynamics, noting that</p> \[\mathrm{KL}\big(p_0 \Vert q_0\big) = -\int_0^{\infty}\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{KL}\big(p_t \Vert q_t\big) dt\] <p>because $\mathrm{KL}\big(p_\infty \Vert q_\infty\big) = 0$ at infinitely large time $t$ since both $p$ and $q$ converges to the same Gaussian noise distribution.</p> <p>The term \(L_t = -\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{KL}\big(p_t \Vert q_t\big)\) is exactly the training objective we needed for training the diffusion model.</p> <p>We will show that as long as the forward diffusion process takes the form:</p> \[d\mathbf{x} = f(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt + g(t) \, d\mathbf{W}.\] <p>the training objective is</p> <p>\(\begin{align*} L_t &amp;= \frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \int p(\mathbf{x}, t)\, \big\|\nabla \log p(\mathbf{x}, t) - \nabla \log q(\mathbf{x}, t)\big\|^2 d\mathbf{x} \\ &amp;\propto \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim p(\mathbf{x}, t)} \big\|\nabla \log p(\mathbf{x}, t) - \nabla \log q(\mathbf{x}, t)\big\|^2 \end{align*}\) where the score functions \(\nabla \log p(\mathbf{x}, t)\) and \(\nabla \log q(\mathbf{x}, t)\) appears naturally inside the L2 objective.</p> <p>In practice, we model the \(\nabla \log q(\mathbf{x}, t)\) (or its rescaled version) as a neural network $\mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}, t)$.

However, maximal likelihood is for distributions. Before we proceed, we need to know how the forward diffusion process effects the distribution.</p> <p>While a stochastic differential equation (SDE) describes how individual samples evolve over time, the probability distribution of a collection of samples follows the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Consider a general SDE of the form:</p> \[d\mathbf{x} = f(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dt + g(t) \, d\mathbf{W}.\] <p>where $f(\mathbf{x}, t)$ is the drift term governing deterministic dynamics, $g(t)$ controls the diffusion strength, and $d\mathbf{W}$ represents Brownian motion increments. If we start with a collection of samples ${\mathbf{x}_0^{(i)}}$ drawn from an initial distribution $p_0(\mathbf{x})$ and evolve each sample according to this SDE, the resulting samples ${\mathbf{x}_t^{(i)}}$ will be distributed according to a time-evolved density $p_t(\mathbf{x})$. The question is: how does $p_t(\mathbf{x})$ relate to the SDE parameters $f$ and $g$?</p> <p>The answer is given by the <strong>Fokker-Planck equation</strong>, which governs how the probability density \(p(\mathbf{x}, t)\) evolves under an SDE:</p> \[\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \left[f(\mathbf{x}, t) p\right] + \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \left[ g(t)^2 p \right].\] <p>This partial differential equation reveals how both drift and diffusion shape the distribution. The first term, \(-\nabla \cdot \left[f(\mathbf{x}, t) p\right]\), is the advection term: it transports probability mass along the drift field \(f(\mathbf{x}, t)\), shifting the distribution deterministically. The second term, \(\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 \left[ g(t)^2 p \right]\), is the diffusion term: it spreads probability mass outward due to stochastic fluctuations, smoothing the distribution over time.</p> <details> <summary><em>A short explaination:</em> (click to expand)</summary> <p>You can find rigorous derivations of the Fokker-Planck equation in many textbooks; here we just sketch an intuitive, 1D argument that explains its form.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Linearity.</strong> Particles following the SDE are independent, so if $p_1(x,t)$ and $p_2(x,t)$ each follow the evolution equation, then any mixture $a p_1 + (1-a)p_2$ should also follow it. This means the PDE for $p(x,t)$ must be linear: \(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + L[p] = 0,\) where $L[p]$ is a linear operator such as $a(x,t)p + b(x,t)\partial_x p + c(x,t)\partial_x^2 p$.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Conservation of probability.</strong> The density is normalized for all time, $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x,t)\,dx = 1$, so \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\,dx = 0.\) This holds if we can write $L[p]$ as a spatial derivative of a <strong>probability flux</strong> $J[p]$: \(L[p] = \frac{\partial J[p]}{\partial x},\) because then \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\partial J[p]}{\partial x}\,dx = J[p]\big|_{-\infty}^{\infty} = 0\) whenever $J[p]$ vanishes at infinity.

It satisfies the following equation \(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 g^2 p}{\partial x^2} = 0\) Therefore the noise term contributes a flux $J_{\text{noise}}[p] = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial g^2 p}{\partial x}$.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Combine them together we have $J_[p] = f(x,t)\,p(x,t)-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial g^2 p}{\partial x}$ hence</p> \[\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \left[f(\mathbf{x}, t) p\right] + \frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial \mathbf{x}^2}.\] </details> <p>To make this precise, consider the <strong>time derivative</strong> of the KL divergence along the forward dynamics. Assume that both $p$ and $q$ satisfy the same Fokker–Planck equation with drift $f(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and diffusion strength $g(t)$:</p> \[\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \big(f p\big) + \frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \nabla^2 p, \qquad \frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \big(f q\big) + \frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \nabla^2 q.\] <p>Writing the KL divergence as</p> \[\mathrm{KL}\big(p_t \Vert q_t\big) = \int p(\mathbf{x}, t) \log \frac{p(\mathbf{x}, t)}{q(\mathbf{x}, t)}\,d\mathbf{x},\] <p>and differentiating under the integral sign, we obtain</p> \[\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{KL}\big(p_t \Vert q_t\big) = \int \left( \log \frac{p}{q} \right) \partial_t p\, d\mathbf{x} + \int p\,\frac{\partial_t q}{q}\, d\mathbf{x},\] <p>where all functions are evaluated at $(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and the integrals are over $\mathbf{x}$. Using the Fokker–Planck operator $\mathcal{L}$ defined by</p> \[\mathcal{L} u = -\nabla \cdot (f u) + \frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \nabla^2 u,\] <p>we can rewrite this as</p> \[\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{KL}\big(p_t \Vert q_t\big) = \int \left( \log \frac{p}{q} \right) \mathcal{L} p\, d\mathbf{x} - \int \frac{p}{q}\,\mathcal{L} q\, d\mathbf{x}.\] <details> <summary><strong>Derivation: how KL changes under the Fokker–Planck equation</strong></summary> Let $r = p/q$. Then $\log (p/q) = \log r$, and we can handle each term by integration by parts (assuming boundary terms vanish, e.g., in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with rapidly decaying densities). For the **drift part** of $\mathcal{L}$, we have $$ \int \log r \, \big[-\nabla \cdot (f p)\big]\, d\mathbf{x} = \int p \, f \cdot \nabla \log r\, d\mathbf{x}, $$ and $$ \int r \, \big[-\nabla \cdot (f q)\big]\, d\mathbf{x} = \int q \, f \cdot \nabla r\, d\mathbf{x}. $$ A direct computation using $r = p/q$ shows that these two contributions cancel **exactly**: $$ p\, f \cdot \nabla \log r - q\, f \cdot \nabla r = 0, $$ so the drift does **not** contribute to the time derivative of KL. The **diffusion part** is responsible for KL contraction. Using $\nabla p = p \nabla \log p$, $\nabla q = q \nabla \log q$, and $$ \nabla r = \nabla\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = p \left(\nabla \log p - \nabla \log q\right), $$ one finds $$ \int \log r \cdot \frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \nabla^2 p\, d\mathbf{x} = -\frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \int \nabla \log r \cdot \nabla p\, d\mathbf{x}, $$ and $$ \int r \cdot \frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \nabla^2 q\, d\mathbf{x} = -\frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \int \nabla r \cdot \nabla q\, d\mathbf{x}. $$ Substituting the expressions above and simplifying, $$ \nabla \log r \cdot \nabla p = p \left( \nabla \log p - \nabla \log q \right) \cdot \nabla \log p, $$ $$ \nabla r \cdot \nabla q = p \left( \nabla \log p - \nabla \log q \right) \cdot \nabla \log q, $$ so that the diffusion contribution to $\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{KL}$ becomes $$ -\frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \int \nabla \log r \cdot \nabla p\, d\mathbf{x} +\frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \int \nabla r \cdot \nabla q\, d\mathbf{x} = -\frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \int p(\mathbf{x}, t) \big\|\nabla \log p - \nabla \log q\big\|^2 \, d\mathbf{x}. $$ </details> <p>Putting everything together, we obtain the key identity</p> \[\frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{KL}\big(p_t \Vert q_t\big) = -\frac{1}{2} g(t)^2 \int p(\mathbf{x}, t)\, \big\|\nabla \log p(\mathbf{x}, t) - \nabla \log q(\mathbf{x}, t)\big\|^2 d\mathbf{x} \;\leq\; 0.\] <p>Thus, along the forward diffusion process, the KL divergence between any two solutions of the same Fokker–Planck equation is <strong>non-increasing</strong>: diffusion strictly contracts KL (unless $p_t = q_t$ in the sense that $\nabla \log p = \nabla \log q$ almost everywhere). Drift does not affect this contraction; it only transports mass without changing the “distance” between $p_t$ and $q_t$ in KL. This monotone decrease of $\mathrm{KL}(p_t \Vert q_t)$ over $t$ underlies many stability results for stochastic dynamics, and in diffusion models it justifies decomposing the global maximum-likelihood objective into local-in-time terms associated with each diffusion step.</p> <p>DDPM is trained to removes the noise $\bar{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}<em>i$ from $\mathbf{x}_i$ in the forward diffusion process, by training a denoising neural network $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}</em>\theta( \mathbf{x}, t_i )$ to predict and remove the noise $\bar{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_i $. This means that DDPM minimizes the <strong>denoising objective</strong> [^Ho2020DenoisingDP]:</p> <p>Note: please use the table of contents as defined in the front matter rather than the traditional markdown styling.</p> <h2 id="equations">Equations</h2> <p>This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MathJax 3</a> engine.

It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d-article</code> element.</p> <div class="fake-img l-body"> <p>.l-body</p> </div> <p>For images you want to display a little larger, try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-page</code>:</p> <div class="fake-img l-page"> <p>.l-page</p> </div> <p>All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit. For instance:</p> <div class="fake-img l-body-outset"> <p>.l-body-outset</p> </div> <div class="fake-img l-page-outset"> <p>.l-page-outset</p> </div> <p>Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width. For this, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-screen</code>. You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.</p> <div class="fake-img l-screen"> <p>.l-screen</p> </div> <div class="fake-img l-screen-inset"> <p>.l-screen-inset</p> </div> <p>The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
